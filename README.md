# Fall Screensaver

aka Autumn Screensaver

A fun autumn background for the fall season!

## Features

It's relatively simple with a lot of small things about it! Of course, there are falling leaves, each of which can be clicked to reveal a quote about autumn. Clicking on the background creates a mini-explosion of circle particles, while clicking on a leaf creates a colorful explosion with stars instead of circles! There are settings to configure whether you want quotes or not, and how many leaves should fall.

## Making it

This is made in pure Vanilla HTML + JavaScript + CSS. It's been a while since I've done one of these!

It's my first time using GSAP, but I'm glad that I did because now I know how to use it for animations :\] I feel like it would've been much harder without GSAP, since it helped to abstract a the realistic leaf falling! However, it was *very* difficult figuring out how things worked in GSAP, even though I was only really using two different functions (`gsap.set` and `gsap.to`). Eventually, with a lot of trial and error, I got it relatively working!
